Created: 5th May 2025 (by Utsav Biswas, 2nd yr PhD, TEELab, CES, IISc)
Purpose: Description of git-hub repo - 'Importance of power-law distributions in ecology'
Project summary: Me (Utsav Biswas) & Vishu (Vishwesha Guttal) have written an article on 'Importance of power-law distributions in ecology'.
Here we give the reader an idea about power-law distributions in general & why they are fascinating. 
Thereafter we mention their advantage & provide examples of different systems in which power-laws have been found.
This repo contains the R codes to generate the figures that are present in this article.

The codes are tested to run on RStudio Build 524.

Required R packages -
'ggplot2'
'gridExtra'
'poweRlaw'
'animation'

All codes are self explanatory and have been commented wherever necessary.
